# BasicTriviaApp

A basic trivia app, which uses the API defined by a test website created for course projects. This API allows the user to get the questions from the website, submit a question to the website and to delete all the questions submitted by the user.
The initial screen displays the trivia option, a submit question option and delete all questions option. A question can be submitted with a question text and mandatory two options with the correct answer selected and an optional image link.
